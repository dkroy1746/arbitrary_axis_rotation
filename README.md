This is a program to rotate any vector by any angle about an arbitrary axis with an arbitrary origin.

1. First you enter the coordinates of the vector that you want to rotate.
2. Enter the angle of rotation in degrees.
3. Enter the coordinates of the axis wrt which you want to rotate the vector.
4. Enter the coordinates of the origin in space wrt which you have your axis and vector.
